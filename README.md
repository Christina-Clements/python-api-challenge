Three Trends
1. In comparing Latitude vs. Max Temp, we can see that the cities closest to the equator tend to have higher maximum temperatures, with an even diminishing of maximum temperatures at the cities respectively farther from the equator.
2. In comparing City Latitude vs. Cloudiness, we see some interesting clusters of cloudiness holding the same percentage across a wide range of latitudes. One example is 80% cloudiness which holds even on 11/22/2019 from -40 latitude through 60 latitude.
3. In the Latitude vs. Wind Speed we see some very significant spikes in wind speed, around -40 latitude as well as 40 latitude and 60 latitude. Future research may include finding if these spikes in wind speed match the jet stream paths.
